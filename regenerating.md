# Regenerating Libraries from Specs

You must duplicate the `fhir_release_template.lbs` and give it the default name according to the table above. Load the `fhir_tools.lbs` and instantiate the `FHIRMenu`. Select the `FHIRGenerator`->`Process Definitions...` command. This needs the folder with the spec definitions `profiles-types.json` and will then generate all classes.
